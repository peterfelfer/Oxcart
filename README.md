# Oxcart
hardware and design files of the Oxcart Titanium atom probe

The Oxcart Titanium atom probe is a open hardware straigt flight path, microelectrode atom probe designed by Peter Felfer in the course of his ERC starting grant. You are very welcome to build you own version, remix it or use components in your own designs. The license is GPL, so be aware that this requires you to then also share. The system is run by the PyCCAPT software package, which contains experiment and system control. Integration of Surface Concept and RoentDek Detectors is implemented.

Here you can find a collection of the files you need to build this atom probe.

Strengths:
Excellent vaccum (<10-11 mbar)
Next to no residual hydrogen
Good mass resolution (limited by stright flight path)
Highest possible detection efficiency
Very flexible hardware for custom experiments
Easy maintainance

Known problems / limitations:
Currently used piezo stage lacks lift force (beeing replaced currently)
Limited low temperature capability (currenlty 35K, but 20K possible with improvements)
Only 3 pucks in load lock currenlty

This machine is constanlty beeing improved, so for the latest design iteration of all components, contact the author. Currenlty, a stage re-design is in progess to integrate a laser with in-situ dual-side focussing.
